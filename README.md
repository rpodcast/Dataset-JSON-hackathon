## üìñ User Guide

### File Upload Process

1.  Select JSON/NDJSON files through the browser
2.  Wait for complete upload (files appear in list)
3.  View metadata in the right panel
4.  Access the Viewer Panel once data is loaded

The JSON Dataset Viewer allows you to select json and ndjson files from a browser. You should be able to only select those supported extensions to avoid errors. Once the selected files are uploaded you are able to see the list of them in the card below, as well as the metadata behind it on the right side. You should only see the Viewer Panel appear when the data is fully loaded. Click on "Remove All Files" button to clear the list, this is basically reloading the session. It is not possible yet to delete one specific dataset from the list. Navigate across the radio buttons to see metadata from the different json files.
